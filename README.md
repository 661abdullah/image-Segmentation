# Image Segmentation 

Welcome to my project on image segmentation using the MobileNetV2 model with TensorFlow Lite! This notebook leverages the powerful Pascal VOC 2012 dataset to demonstrate the capabilities of MobileNetV2 in identifying and delineating objects within images.

## Features

- **Model Insight**: Dive into how MobileNetV2 can be adapted for the complex task of image segmentation.
- **Performing Inference**: Step-by-step guide on executing inference with a TensorFlow Lite model.

## Setup

Before you dive in, make sure you have TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite installed in your environment. This notebook will guide you through setting everything up for successful image segmentation.

## How to Use This Notebook

Follow the instructions in this notebook to:
- Prepare images for segmentation.
- Run the TensorFlow Lite model to segment the images.
- Analyze and utilize the segmentation results.

For those looking to go further or tweak the model, I recommend exploring the detailed resources provided by TensorFlowâ€™s model repository.
